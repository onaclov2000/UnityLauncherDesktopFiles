UnityLauncherDesktopFiles
=========================

Whenever I create a unity launcher desktop file for a project that doesn't automatically work (or have one), I'll place it here, so I can re-download it.

If you have one created, go ahead and fork it and put in a merge request and I'll add it. 

So far truecrypt and eclipse have been added.

Create a new folder, add the .desktop file, additionally if the icon isn't easy to find (or path unknown) include the icon, so the user can reference that one as well.
